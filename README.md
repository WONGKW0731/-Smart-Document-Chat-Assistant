# Smart Document Chat Assistant ü§ñ

This project is a versatile, web-based chat assistant built with Flask that allows you to interact with various types of documents using powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). You can upload a PDF, an image, or an audio file and ask questions about its content. The application supports switching between multiple AI providers: **Google Gemini**, **Cohere**, and **Groq**.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Chat with different file types.
    * [cite_start]üìñ **PDFs**: Upload a PDF and ask questions about its text content[cite: 1].
    * [cite_start]üñºÔ∏è **Images**: Upload an image and use vision-enabled models to analyze it[cite: 1].

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Before You Start

This application relies on external services and a crucial local dependency. Please review these points carefully before installation.

### 1. API Keys

[cite_start]You **must** have valid API keys for the services you intend to use (Gemini, Cohere, Groq)[cite: 1]. The application will not work without them.

### 2. FFmpeg Installation

[cite_start]**FFmpeg** is a critical dependency required for processing audio files (converting them to a compatible format for transcription)[cite: 1]. It must be installed separately on your system.

* **Windows**:
    1.  Download a static build from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    2.  Extract the folder (e.g., to `C:\ffmpeg`).
    3.  Add the `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to your system's **PATH** environment variable.

* **macOS** (using Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

* **Linux** (using apt for Debian/Ubuntu):
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
````

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS & Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Configure Your API Keys

[cite\_start]Open the `NLP.py` file and replace the empty placeholder strings with your actual API keys[cite: 1].

```python
# NLP.py - Lines 21-23

# IMPORTANT: Replace these with your actual API keys
GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
COHERE_API_KEY = "YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY_HERE"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 5\. Configure FFmpeg Path (Crucial Step\!)

The script needs to know where the FFmpeg executable is located. [cite\_start]The current code has a **hardcoded path for Windows**[cite: 1]. You **must** update this if your path is different or if you are on macOS or Linux.

  * **If you added FFmpeg to your system PATH (recommended)**, you can try commenting out or deleting the hardcoded lines. The `pydub` library often finds it automatically.
  * [cite\_start]**If not**, update the paths in `NLP.py` to point to your FFmpeg executables[cite: 1].

<!-- end list -->

```python
# NLP.py - Lines 14-15 and 33-36

# For Windows (adjust if your path is different)
AudioSegment.converter = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"
AudioSegment.ffprobe = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe"

# You might need to adjust these paths as well
ffmpeg_path = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"
ffprobe_path = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe"
```

For **macOS/Linux**, the paths are typically found automatically if installed via a package manager. If not, you may need to find them (`which ffmpeg`) and set the path accordingly (e.g., `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg`).

### 6\. Run the Application

[cite\_start]Once the setup is complete, run the Flask application[cite: 1]:

```bash
python NLP.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to **https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000** to start using the chat assistant\!
